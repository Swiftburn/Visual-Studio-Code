        <h3><a href="https://github.com/Swiftburn/Web_Programming_2022/tree/master/CompoundinterestCalc">Compound Interest Calculator</a></h3>
            <li>A compound interest calculator that outputs a table with the results.</li>
            <li>Started with html and built a form, from that I went on to javascript to build a compound interest calculator, and finally added some CSS to make it look more pleasing.</li>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/Swiftburn/Web_Programming_2022/tree/master/clockTower">Clock Tower</a></h3>
            <li>Copied an existing website just via sight</li>
            <li>I started with the easier things such as text (paragraphs, sections, headers, etc.) then I moved on to the more difficult to gauge css and did my best to get as close as possible.</li>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/Swiftburn/Web_Programming_2022/tree/master/Resume%20Project">Midterm Resume</a></h3> 
            <li>Resume website created to test our skills with html and css</li>
            <li>I did go a bit far with this creation because I found some exciting new css features to make things stand out</li>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/Swiftburn/Web_Programming_2022/tree/master/Resume_Final">This Website!</a></h3>
            <li>This is a continuation of the Resume Website midterm but we had to built upon it with php and javascript!</li>
            <li>Yes this very website is a project I worked on!</li>
            <li>Since I already had the basics set, I just had to split the resume into 4 different pages, add an API through javascript, create an SQL database connection via php, and finally decorate it with css but sparingly this time.</li>
