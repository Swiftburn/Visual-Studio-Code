        <h1>HELLO, I AM ADOLFO BARRIENTOS</h1>
        <p>
            I love to solve problems and I'm down to earth. Some things I'm interested in are web development, app development, databases, and automation. I am most comfortable doing back end with the languages; c++, javascript and python. I am not limited to only backend as I am currently working on frontend (html and php), I am always hungry to learn whether on the job or on my own.
