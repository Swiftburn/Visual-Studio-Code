        My name is Adolfo and I enjoy gaming and anime. I enjoy learning things on my own but I do not enjoy school because of quizzes and exams. I'm not great at memorizing but if the grade were based on a project, that would be more enticing. <br>
        I also have 6 cats which happened because I picked up a stray mama cat. She happened to be pregnant with 5 kittens and so I ended up with 6 cats. I'm not sure how old mama cat is but the kittens are now 2 years old and are better behaved than when they were smaller.
